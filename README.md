> An **intelligent static analysis tool** built in **Java** that scans source files to measure code quality, maintainability, and complexity — offering meaningful feedback for developers.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **Static Code Analysis** — Examines Java source files for structural and logical issues  
- 🧩 **Unused Variable Detection** — Finds variables that are declared but never used  
- 📏 **Long Method Identification** — Detects methods longer than 30 lines  
- 🗒️ **Missing Comments Check** — Reports missing class or method-level documentation  
- ⚙️ **Complexity Evaluation** — Analyzes nested loops and conditional structures  
- 📊 **Code Quality Scoring** — Generates a **quantitative score (0–100)** for each file  
- 🧾 **Report Export** — Optionally exports analysis results to a text file
